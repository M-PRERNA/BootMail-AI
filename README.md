# BootMail-AI

**BootMail AI** is a full-stack, AI-powered email assistant developed as a browser extension. It seamlessly integrates a custom **Spring Boot backend** with the **Gmail UI**, enabling users to generate instant, context-aware email replies with the click of a button. 

The project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of client-side and server-side development by:

* **Engineering a RESTful API** in Java with Spring Boot to process user requests and communicate with a powerful AI model.
* **Developing a dynamic content script** to inject a custom "AI Reply" button directly into the Gmail compose toolbar, ensuring a native user experience.
* **Implementing robust CORS security** and **browser extension permissions** to allow for secure cross-origin communication between the extension and the backend server.

This project showcases a hands-on application of modern web technologies to solve a practical problem, highlighting skills in API design, full-stack integration, and browser extension development.
